# C++ Projects 

## ***Lib Directory***
The lib directory contains basic data stuctures and algorithms like BST, hash tables, linked list, threaded mergesort and quicksort etc which I wrote primarily to do project assigned in my CS101 class. I designed them to be resuable and customizable in future use. 


## ***Projects***
Each project were assigned to me during my CS class. Each directory contains the project objective and implementation.
